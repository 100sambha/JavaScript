    <h1>Why Learn JavaScript?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is used on both the client-side and the server-side. On the client-side, the code is run and displayed by the browser.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a platform-independent language. Any browser supporting JavaScript can run the code irrespective of the operating system</li>
        <li>JavaScript uses the just-in-time compilation technique. Since the compilation is handled at run time, JavaScript is considered an interpreted language.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That is, a variable containing a number may be reassigned to a string.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ex 1. Printing Hello World Program</p>
    <p>console.log('Hello World');</p>
